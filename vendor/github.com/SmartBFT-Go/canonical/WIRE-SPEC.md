# Canonical wire specification, v1

Every byte this system hashes or signs is produced by the rules below. This document plus
[`testdata/vectors.json`](testdata/vectors.json) is sufficient to reproduce those bytes in any
language.

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY are used as in RFC 2119.

## 1. Scope and status

1.1 Status: **frozen v1, additive only**. Once a structure's encoding ships, its bytes never
change.

1.2 A new field means a new structure or a new `Version`. It never means an edited encoding.

1.3 Changing an existing encoding is a **breaking release**. Every digest, signature and state
root produced under the old bytes stops verifying, so the change requires a coordinated
upgrade of every replica in the cluster.

1.4 `testdata/vectors.json` is the **normative test-vector annex** of this document. An
implementation is conformant iff it reproduces every vector in that file: for each entry in
`vectors`, the DER hex in `der` and its SHA-256 in `sha256`; for each entry in `merkle`, the
32-byte digest in `hash`.

1.4.1 An entry in `vectors` carries `name`, `structure`, `fields`, `der`, `sha256` and
`annotation`. **`fields` is normative**: it is the value `der` MUST decode to, and an
implementation that reproduces `der` without agreeing with `fields` has reproduced a hex string
rather than a structure. Its representation is fixed — a byte string is lowercase hex with no
separator, an INTEGER is a JSON number, a `SEQUENCE OF` is a JSON array, and an element type is a
JSON object keyed by field name. `structure` names the §3 subsection the entry encodes.

1.4.2 `fields` MAY also carry a value that is **not** a field of the structure, where a verifier
needs it and the wire does not transmit it. There are exactly two, both on a `SignedBlobV1` entry:
`GenesisDigest` and `PubKey`, which §3.9.1 says the verifier supplies from its own genesis rather
than reads from the blob. An implementation MUST NOT treat either as a decoded field. A key that
is neither a field of `structure` nor one of these two is an error in the annex.

1.4.3 An entry in `merkle` carries `name`, `fn`, `treeID`, `depth`, `hash` and the inputs `fn`
names: `key` and `val` for a leaf, `left` and `right` for an internal node, neither for an empty
one.

1.5 The `annotation` arrays in the annex are informative, not normative. They exist so a vector
can be reviewed in a diff without decoding hex by hand.

1.6 Where this document and the annex disagree, the annex wins and this document is in error.

1.7 Two encodings are specified, each for its own job: ASN.1 DER (§3) for structured, evolving
values, and fixed-width domain-separated concatenation (§5) for Merkle node hashing. §5.6 gives
the measurement that justifies the split.

## 2. The type profile

2.1 The safety of the DER encoding comes from the restricted set of value types, not from any
particular encoder. A conformant implementation MUST restrict itself to the same set.

2.2 Allowed:

| Type | ASN.1 | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| `Version` integer | INTEGER | `02 <len> <minimal signed big-endian>` — MUST be the first field of every top-level structure, see §4 |
| byte string | OCTET STRING | `04 <len> <bytes>` |
| 64-bit signed integer | INTEGER | `02 <len> <minimal signed big-endian>` |
| boolean | BOOLEAN | `01 01 00` false, `01 01 ff` true |
| nested structure | SEQUENCE | `30 <len> <fields in declaration order>` |
| homogeneous list | SEQUENCE OF | `30 <len> <elements>` — the producer MUST sort deterministically before encoding. Two structures carve out an exception and each says why: §3.7.4 and §3.11.3 |

2.3 Banned, with the reason for each ban:

| Banned | Reason |
|---|---|
| text string | The ASN.1 tag flips between PrintableString (`13`) and UTF8String (`0c`) depending on the *content*. A non-Go implementer would have to reimplement Go's exact PrintableString predicate to reproduce our bytes. Use a byte string. |
| date/time value | Truncates to whole seconds, changes tag between UTCTime and GeneralizedTime at the 1950 and 2050 boundaries, and encodes the timezone offset — so the same instant expressed in two locations produces different bytes. Use `int64` Unix nanoseconds. |
| platform-width integer | Width varies by architecture, so two replicas can disagree. |
| unsigned 64-bit integer | Not representable; see §3.5. |
| fixed-size array | Encode as OCTET STRING with a length check at construction. |
| floating point | Not deterministic across implementations, and banned in the deterministic core generally. |
| map / dictionary | Iteration order is unspecified. |
| `OPTIONAL` / `DEFAULT` / omit-if-empty | Makes absent and zero-valued indistinguishable, which is the opposite of what a frozen encoding wants. |
| `SET OF` | Sorted on encode but **unsorted input is accepted on decode**, so two distinct byte strings decode to the same value: malleable. Use SEQUENCE OF and sort at construction. |

2.4 Length encoding MUST be DER-minimal and definite:

```
length 0..127      short form, one byte:      2b            = 43
length 128..255    long form, 0x81 + 1 byte:  81 8a         = 138
length 256..65535  long form, 0x82 + 2 bytes: 82 01 00      = 256
```

`81 80` is the only valid encoding of length 128. `82 00 80` MUST be rejected. Indefinite length
(`80` … `00 00`) MUST be rejected.

2.4.1 The long form is the general DER one and is not limited to the three rows above: `0x8n`
introduces `n` length octets. Two rules make it unambiguous and both MUST be enforced — the first
length octet MUST NOT be zero, and the encoded value MUST NOT fit a shorter form, so `82 00 80` and
`82 00 2b` are both rejected for the second reason as well as the first. `0xff` is reserved by
X.690 and MUST be rejected.

2.4.2 An implementation MAY refuse a length beyond a ceiling rather than allocate against it, and
that ceiling MUST be documented. The reference implementation's is 2^23 bytes;
`ci/verify_vectors.py` refuses more than four length octets. Two implementations disagreeing about
where the ceiling sits disagree about the set of accepted inputs, which §4.2.2 says is exactly
where an attacker works — so it is a stated property, not a private choice. Nothing this system
encodes comes near either bound.

2.5 INTEGER content MUST be minimal two's-complement big-endian, and INTEGER is **signed**:

```
0    -> 02 01 00
7    -> 02 01 07
127  -> 02 01 7f
128  -> 02 02 00 80     leading 00: without it 0x80 would decode as -128
2^63-1 -> 02 08 7fffffffffffffff
```

`02 02 00 01` (non-minimal 1) MUST be rejected. INTEGER content MUST be at least one octet:
`02 00` is not the encoding of any value, 0 included.

2.6 An empty byte string encodes to `04 00`. A conformant implementation MUST NOT attempt to
distinguish an absent byte string from an empty one — the encoding cannot express the
difference. A caller needing that distinction MUST carry a separate boolean or use a distinct
structure.

## 3. Structures

### 3.1 `Header`

Wire order is the order below. It is frozen.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `PrevStateRoot` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 32 bytes, on encode **and** on decode. |
| 3 | `PrevSeq` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed. Sequence number of the previous decision. |
| 4 | `ConsensusTime` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed, Unix **nanoseconds**. See §6. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `header/v1/seq-128`:

```
30 2c                                SEQUENCE, 44 bytes
   02 01 01                          INTEGER 1                 Version
   04 20 0000…0000                   OCTET STRING, 32 bytes    PrevStateRoot
   02 02 00 80                       INTEGER 128               PrevSeq
   02 01 00                          INTEGER 0                 ConsensusTime
```

3.1.1 A decoder MUST reject a `Header` whose `PrevStateRoot` is not 32 bytes. An encoder would
never produce one, and a consumer that copies a short root into a fixed 32-byte buffer would
silently zero-pad it and then compare it against real state roots.

3.1.2 `ConsensusTime` as `int64` nanoseconds overflows in the year 2262.

### 3.2 `ProposalV0`

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Payload` | OCTET STRING | Opaque to this layer. |
| 2 | `Header` | OCTET STRING | Carries the DER of §3.1 in this system, but is opaque here. |
| 3 | `Metadata` | OCTET STRING | Opaque to this layer. |
| 4 | `VerificationSequence` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `proposal/v0/smartbft-reference`:

```
30 12                                SEQUENCE, 18 bytes
   04 03 50 41 59                    OCTET STRING "PAY"        Payload
   04 03 48 44 52                    OCTET STRING "HDR"        Header
   04 03 4d 45 54                    OCTET STRING "MET"        Metadata
   02 01 07                          INTEGER 7                 VerificationSequence
```

3.2.1 **`ProposalV0` has no `Version` field.** It is an allowlisted exception to §4.1, which lists
them all. The structure mirrors an encoding that already shipped in SmartBFT; adding a `Version` field would
change every digest the consensus library has ever produced. The `V0` in the name is the version
tag, carried out of band.

3.2.2 Field order is **declaration order**, as shown above. Any source that lists these fields in
another order — including the composite literal in the upstream `Proposal.Digest()` — is
describing something cosmetic. It does not affect the bytes.

3.2.3 The digest of a proposal is `SHA-256` over the DER of §3.2, rendered lowercase-hex when a
string is required. Vector `proposal/v0/smartbft-reference` records both, and the digest there is
the value the unmodified upstream implementation produces for that input.

### 3.3 Structures added later

Any structure added after v1 MUST carry `Version` as its first field, MUST be added to the annex
with its own vector before first use, and MUST NOT change any encoding in §3.1 or §3.2.

### 3.4 Digests

Unless a structure's own section says otherwise, the digest of a structure is `SHA-256` over its
complete DER encoding — the full `30 <len> …` SEQUENCE, not the contents alone.

### 3.5 Unsigned 64-bit values

Values that are logically unsigned (sequence numbers, node identifiers, nanosecond timestamps)
are carried as signed 64-bit INTEGER with a documented range invariant: the producer MUST reject
values above 2^63-1 at construction. They are all far below that bound in practice. This keeps a
plain INTEGER on the wire and avoids the arbitrary-precision encoding a true unsigned 64-bit
value would need.

### 3.6 `GenesisV1`

The pinned cluster definition. Its digest is §3.4's default — `SHA-256` over the complete DER —
and that digest is the value an operator distributes out of band for every node to check its own
copy against. The encoding is therefore frozen on the same terms as §3.1.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `TrustDomain` | OCTET STRING | The SPIFFE trust domain, e.g. `cluster.example`. MUST be non-empty. |
| 3 | `CARoot` | OCTET STRING | DER of the root certificate. Opaque to this layer. |
| 4 | `MaxNodes` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed. MUST be ≥ 0, and MUST be ≥ the number of members. |
| 5 | `Members` | SEQUENCE OF `GenesisMemberV1` | Sorted strictly ascending by `NodeID`. |

`GenesisMemberV1`, the element type of `Members`:

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NodeID` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed, logically unsigned per §3.5. MUST be ≥ 0. |
| 2 | `SpiffeID` | OCTET STRING | MUST equal `spiffe://<TrustDomain>/node/<NodeID>` byte for byte, with this structure's `TrustDomain` and the member's own `NodeID` in decimal without leading zeros. See §3.6.6. |
| 3 | `LeafPubKey` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 32 bytes: an Ed25519 public key. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `genesis/v1/long-form-length`:

```
30 81 cc                              SEQUENCE, 204 bytes — long form: 81 says one length byte follows
   02 01 01                           INTEGER 1                Version
   04 0f 636c…6c65                    OCTET STRING, 15 bytes   TrustDomain "cluster.example"
   04 20 ca*32                        OCTET STRING, 32 bytes   CARoot

         02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                NodeID
         04 1f 7370…2f31              OCTET STRING, 31 bytes   SpiffeID "spiffe://cluster.example/node/1"
         04 20 b2*32                  OCTET STRING, 32 bytes   LeafPubKey
      30 46                           SEQUENCE, 70 bytes       Members[1]
         02 01 02                     INTEGER 2                NodeID
         04 1f 7370…2f32              OCTET STRING, 31 bytes   SpiffeID "spiffe://cluster.example/node/2"
         04 20 c3*32                  OCTET STRING, 32 bytes   LeafPubKey
```

3.6.1 **`GenesisMemberV1` has no `Version` field.** It is an element of `Members` and never
appears on the wire alone, so §4.1 — which binds top-level structures — is satisfied by the
`Version` of the containing `GenesisV1`. A change to the member layout produces a new version of
`GenesisV1`, not a version field on the member.

3.6.2 `Members` is a SEQUENCE OF under §2.2, so **the producer sorts and the producer alone**. A
conformant encoder MUST reject an unsorted or duplicated set rather than sort it, and a decoder
MUST reject one too. Sorting on behalf of the caller would give one membership two spellings, and
only one of them hashes to the digest the operator pinned.

3.6.3 Every constraint in the two tables is checked on encode **and** on decode. The asymmetric
alternative — validate on the way out, trust on the way in — accepts bytes this specification says
cannot exist, and those bytes have digests of their own.

3.6.4 An empty `Members` encodes as `30 00`. Per §2.6 there is no way to distinguish it from an
absent one, and none is needed: a cluster with no members is expressible and is pinned by vector
`genesis/v1/no-members`.

3.6.5 `MaxNodes` is the cluster's reconfiguration ceiling, not its current size. It is carried in
genesis because it bounds the member count at every later reconfiguration, and a bound that is not
covered by the pinned digest is a bound an operator can move.

3.6.6 `SpiffeID` is **derived, not merely shaped**. Both of its variable parts are fields of this
same structure, so each member has exactly one legal identity: an implementation computes the
value and compares, rather than parsing whatever it was handed. Accepting a member whose
`SpiffeID` names a different node or a foreign trust domain would put two identities for one node
under the pinned digest, and the identity is what the leaf certificate is later checked against.
`CARoot` is the only cell in either table with no constraint on its content — §3.6's table calls it
opaque, this layer does not interpret certificates, and it stays exempt.

### 3.7 `SignatureSetV0`

The commit signatures of the previous decision, hashed into
`ViewMetadata.PrevCommitSignatureDigest`. The digest is §3.4's default — `SHA-256` over the
complete DER — and every replica recomputes it over the signatures it received from the leader
and compares. These bytes have been in ledgers since before this document existed; §3.7.3 says
what that means.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Sigs` | SEQUENCE OF `SignerSigV0` | Producer order, **not** sorted. See §3.7.4. |

`SignerSigV0`, the element type of `Sigs`:

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Signer` | INTEGER | 64-bit signed, logically unsigned per §3.5. The node identifier. |
| 2 | `Value` | OCTET STRING | The signature bytes. Opaque to this layer, and may be empty. |
| 3 | `Msg` | OCTET STRING | The auxiliary message the signature covers. Opaque, and may be empty. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `sigset/v0/three-signers`:

```
30 26                       SEQUENCE, 38 bytes

      30 0c                 SEQUENCE, 12 bytes       Sigs[2]
         02 02 01 2c        INTEGER 300              Signer
         04 02 56 33        OCTET STRING "V3"        Value
         04 02 4d 33        OCTET STRING "M3"        Msg
```

3.7.1 **Neither structure has a `Version` field.** Both are allowlisted exceptions to §4.1, on the
same grounds as §3.2.1: they reproduce an encoding SmartBFT already shipped, and adding a
`Version` field would change every `PrevCommitSignatureDigest` already written to a ledger. The
`V0` in the name is the version tag, carried out of band. `SignerSigV0` would additionally
qualify under the §3.6.1 rule — it is an element of a SEQUENCE OF and never appears on the wire
alone.

3.7.2 Field order is declaration order, inherited from SmartBFT's internal `IntDoubleByte` and
`IntDoubleBytes`. Those two types are what the pre-migration implementation marshalled, and this
section is a transcription of their layout, not a redesign of it.

3.7.3 This section and the `sigset/v0/*` vectors are a **documentation backfill**. The encoding
shipped without them; no byte changes here, so §1.3 does not apply and the release carrying this
section is additive. The two non-empty vectors record digests produced by the unmodified
pre-migration implementation for those inputs, which is why they can be checked against something
other than this package's own output.

3.7.4 `Sigs` is a SEQUENCE OF but is **not** sorted, so it does not meet §2.2's sort requirement.
The order is the producer's, it is carried alongside the signatures themselves, and the verifier
recomputes the digest over the list in the order it received it — the same signatures in another
order are a different digest. Recorded as an exception, not defended as a design: a v1 structure
carrying the same data would sort by `Signer` and reject duplicates.

3.7.5 An empty `Sigs` encodes as `30 02 30 00` and is pinned by vector `sigset/v0/empty`. SmartBFT
returns a nil digest for an empty signature set without reaching the encoder, so those bytes are
not hashed in practice; the vector exists so that an implementer does not have to guess.

### 3.8 `SignedV1`

The signature envelope. **Every Ed25519 signature in this system is a signature over the DER of a
`SignedV1` and nothing else** — commit signatures, the consensus library's opaque `Sign`, client
requests and read-index attestations alike. There is no second signing format and no carve-out,
so an implementer has one structure to reproduce and adding a signature kind later costs a value
in §3.8.1 rather than a new encoding.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `Purpose` | INTEGER | MUST be one of the four values in §3.8.1. Every other value, including 0 and 5, MUST be rejected. |
| 3 | `GenesisDigest` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 32 bytes: the digest of the cluster's `GenesisV1` under §3.4. |
| 4 | `Payload` | OCTET STRING | The purpose's own structure, DER. See §3.8.5. MAY be empty. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `signed/v1/commit`:

```
30 31                           SEQUENCE, 49 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                 Version
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                 Purpose — commit signature
   04 20 6f01…dc56              OCTET STRING, 32 bytes    GenesisDigest (SHA-256 of genesis/v1/n4)
   04 07 5041594c4f4144         OCTET STRING "PAYLOAD"    Payload — opaque at this layer
```

3.8.1 The purpose values are **frozen**:

| Value | Purpose | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | commit signature | A consenter's signature on a proposal. `Payload` is §3.10. |
| 2 | opaque sign | The consensus library's general-purpose `Sign`, including view-change `RawViewData`. `Payload` is the argument as handed in. |
| 3 | client request | A client's signature on its own request. `Payload` is §3.11. |
| 4 | read-index attestation | A replica's attestation over `(view, seq, nonce)`. `Payload` is §3.12. |

Adding a value is additive under §7 and requires a new annex vector. Changing or reusing a value
is a breaking change under §1.3, and a worse one than most: it does not merely stop new signatures
verifying, it makes old ones verify under a purpose their signer never intended.

3.8.2 A verifier MUST check `Purpose` and `GenesisDigest` **before** it checks the signature. A
signature made for another purpose or another cluster is then rejected on structure rather than on
cryptography, which is a cheaper rejection and a clearer one — the reason is a field, not a failed
curve operation.

3.8.3 `Purpose` is inside the signed bytes, so two envelopes differing only in `Purpose` are two
different byte strings with two unrelated digests. That is what makes a captured commit signature
useless as a read-index attestation: the attestation verifier reconstructs an envelope carrying
purpose 4, and no signature over purpose 1 covers those bytes. Vectors `signed/v1/commit`,
`signed/v1/opaque`, `signed/v1/client-request` and `signed/v1/read-index` carry one payload under
all four purposes and pin exactly this.

3.8.4 `GenesisDigest` is inside the signed bytes for the same reason, one scope up: a signature
minted in one cluster covers bytes no other cluster reconstructs, so a test cluster's signature
replayed against production is not a signature at all. It costs 32 bytes per signature and it
makes "which cluster is this for" answerable from the bytes alone. The digest is supplied by the
verifier and never transmitted — see §3.9.1.

3.8.5 `Payload` is the purpose's own structure, DER-encoded, and opaque at this layer. Purpose 1
carries §3.10. Purpose 2 carries whatever the caller handed to `Sign` and this document does not
constrain it. Purpose 3 carries §3.11 and purpose 4 carries §3.12.

**The mapping binds the producer of an envelope and the verifier of that purpose. It does not bind
this layer**: an encoder or decoder of `SignedV1` MUST NOT parse `Payload`, whatever the purpose.
Purpose 2 settles the point by itself — no encoder can validate an argument this document declines
to constrain — and the alternative puts four structure parsers inside one encoder. Annex vectors
`signed/v1/commit`, `signed/v1/opaque`, `signed/v1/client-request`, `signed/v1/read-index` and
`signed/v1/long-form-length` accordingly carry a deliberately opaque `Payload`: they exercise the
envelope's own encoding and §3.8.3's purpose separation, and they are not examples of a
well-formed system envelope. `blob/v1/basic` and `blob/v1/signed-by-test-key` are, because §3.9's
table requires a real payload.

3.8.6 Every constraint in the table is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's grounds. A
verifier reconstructs this envelope rather than receiving it, so what it reconstructs must be
something a signer could have emitted.

### 3.9 `SignedBlobV1`

A signature travelling beside the payload it was made over. This is a transport structure, not a
signed one: it is never itself signed, and `Value` is a signature over the §3.8 envelope
reconstructed from its other fields.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `Purpose` | INTEGER | MUST be one of the four values in §3.8.1. |
| 3 | `Payload` | OCTET STRING | The purpose's own structure, DER. MUST be non-empty. |
| 4 | `Value` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 64 bytes: an Ed25519 signature. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `blob/v1/basic`:

```
30 76                           SEQUENCE, 118 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                 Version
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                 Purpose — commit signature
   04 2c 302a…4155 58           OCTET STRING, 44 bytes    Payload (commit-payload/v1/with-aux)
   04 40 0001…3e3f              OCTET STRING, 64 bytes    Value
```

3.9.1 **The envelope is reconstructed, never transmitted.** There is no `GenesisDigest` field
here, and adding one would be a mistake rather than a convenience. A verifier MUST build
`SignedV1{1, Purpose, <its own genesis digest>, Payload}`, marshal it under §3.8, and verify
`Value` over exactly those bytes. A signature minted against another cluster therefore does not
carry a wrong digest that some check has to catch — it covers bytes this verifier never produces,
and there is no field in the blob for an attacker to set. Vector `blob/v1/basic` records the
reconstructed envelope and its digest in its annotation so the rule is exhibited and not only
asserted.

3.9.2 The rule is also the only one that works everywhere. On the consensus path the signature
travels in the consensus library's own `Signature.Msg`, which carries the payload and has nowhere
to put an envelope. Reconstruction covers that case and the blob case with one convention, so §3.8
keeps its "no exceptions".

3.9.3 **There is no signer field.** Every payload names its own signer — a client request by
carrying its certificate, a read-index attestation by carrying its signer identifier, a consenter
signature by the node identifier the consensus library already transports. A signer named beside a
signature rather than inside the signed bytes can be rewritten by whoever relays it, which turns
an identifier into a suggestion. This is the same rule as §3.6.6 and the same rule the transport
layer applies to node identity: identity comes from something verified, never from a field
alongside it.

3.9.4 `Payload` MUST be non-empty. An envelope over nothing is a signature every purpose would
have to reject on its own terms, and rejecting it once here keeps that check out of four
verifiers.

3.9.5 Every constraint in the table is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's grounds —
`Payload`'s content excepted, per §3.9.6.

3.9.6 **`Payload` MUST be the DER of the structure §3.8.5 maps to `Purpose`**, purpose 2 excepted
because §3.8.5 leaves it unconstrained. Unlike §3.8.5's envelope a blob always carries a real
payload, so the rule is checkable here — but it binds the producer, and a decoder of the container
is no more required to parse `Payload` than §3.8.5's is. A conformance checker over the annex
SHOULD check it, and `ci/verify_vectors.py` does: `blob/v1/basic` decodes as the `CommitPayloadV1`
purpose 1 names, and `blob/v1/signed-by-test-key` as the `ReadIndexV1` purpose 4 names.

### 3.10 `CommitPayloadV1`

`SignedV1.Payload` under purpose 1. It is what a consenter's signature on a proposal actually
covers.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `ProposalDigest` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 32 bytes: the digest of the proposal under §3.2.3. |
| 3 | `Aux` | OCTET STRING | The consensus library's auxiliary input, relayed verbatim. Opaque to this layer, and MAY be empty. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `commit-payload/v1/with-aux`:

```
30 2a                           SEQUENCE, 42 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                 Version
   04 20 35d8…7522              OCTET STRING, 32 bytes    ProposalDigest (SHA-256 of proposal/v0/smartbft-reference)
   04 03 415558                 OCTET STRING "AUX"        Aux
```

3.10.1 **The proposal digest and the auxiliary data are in one structure on purpose.** A signature
over the digest alone leaves the aux unsigned, so whoever relays the signature can pair it with an
aux of their choosing; a signature over the aux alone can be lifted onto another proposal. Binding
both under one signature makes a consenter signature non-transplantable in either direction.
Vectors `commit-payload/v1/with-aux` and `commit-payload/v1/empty-aux` name one proposal and
differ only in the aux, and they hash to unrelated digests.

3.10.2 `Aux` is opaque here. This layer does not parse it, does not constrain its contents, and
does not require it to be present — the aux feeds consensus bookkeeping, and what that bookkeeping
does with malformed contents is that layer's obligation, not this one's.

3.10.3 There is no signer field, on §3.9.3's grounds: the consensus library already transports the
node identifier alongside the signature.

3.10.4 Every constraint in the table is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's grounds.

### 3.11 `ClientRequestV1`

`SignedV1.Payload` under purpose 3, and the structure a non-Go client has to produce. It is
**self-contained**: verifying it needs these bytes and the genesis CA root, nothing else.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `ClientCert` | OCTET STRING | DER of the client's leaf certificate. MUST be non-empty. |
| 3 | `Intermediates` | SEQUENCE OF `CertificateV1` | Ordered leaf-ward to root-ward. MAY be empty; see §3.11.2. |
| 4 | `RequestID` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 16 bytes. See §3.11.1. |
| 5 | `Expiry` | INTEGER | Unix nanoseconds. MUST be strictly positive. See §3.11.4. |
| 6 | `Payload` | OCTET STRING | The application request. Opaque at this layer, and MAY be empty. |

`CertificateV1`, the element type of `Intermediates`:

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DER` | OCTET STRING | DER of one certificate. MUST be non-empty. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `client-request/v1/no-intermediates`:

```
30 37                           SEQUENCE, 55 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                Version
   04 0b 434c…4146              OCTET STRING, 11 bytes   ClientCert — DER of the client leaf
   30 00                        SEQUENCE OF, 0 bytes     Intermediates — absent chain
   04 10 0001…0e0f              OCTET STRING, 16 bytes   RequestID
   02 08 18867251edfa0000       INTEGER 1767225600000000000   Expiry — Unix nanoseconds
   04 07 5041594c4f4144         OCTET STRING "PAYLOAD"   Payload — the application request
```

3.11.1 **`RequestID` MUST be exactly 16 bytes**, on encode and on decode. This is not a size hint.
The consensus library identifies a request by the unescaped concatenation of its client identifier
and its ID, so a variable-width ID lets one client spell an ID that lands inside another client's
namespace and collides two distinct requests in the pool. A fixed width removes the ambiguity at
the encoding layer, where no verifier has to remember to check it.

3.11.2 **An absent chain and an empty chain are one value**, encoded as the empty SEQUENCE OF
`30 00`. `OPTIONAL` is banned by §2.3, so there is no third spelling and §2.6 applies: an
implementation MUST NOT attempt to distinguish absent from empty. A decoder MAY produce either an
empty list or a null list in its own language — Go's `encoding/asn1` allocates an empty non-nil
slice — and what MUST hold is that re-encoding the decoded value reproduces the bytes the
signature was made over.

3.11.3 **`Intermediates` is ordered, and the order is inside the signed bytes.** Leaf-ward first,
root-ward last. It is a SEQUENCE OF but §2.2's producer-sorts rule does not apply: the order is
the chain itself and carries meaning, so there is nothing to sort it by. Two requests with the
same certificates in two orders are two different byte strings with two unrelated digests, which
is what stops a relay from reordering the chain and keeping the signature.

3.11.4 **The client's identity is derived from `ClientCert`, never from the payload.** There is
deliberately no `ClientID` field. A verifier chains `ClientCert` through `Intermediates` to the CA
root pinned in `GenesisV1`, and the client's identity is the SPIFFE ID of that verified
certificate. This is §3.9.3's rule and the transport layer's rule: identity comes from something
verified, never from a field alongside it.

3.11.5 **`Expiry` is compared against the committed `ConsensusTime` of the proposal header, never
against a local clock.** §6 explains why: two replicas checking the same request against two local
clocks reach two verdicts on the same bytes, and that is divergence rather than rejection. A
non-positive `Expiry` is rejected here because no `ConsensusTime` admits it, which makes it
malformed rather than merely expired. The ceiling on how far ahead an expiry may sit is a cluster
policy and is specified outside this document.

3.11.6 **`ClientCert` is carried, not fingerprinted.** The request costs several hundred bytes
more for it, and the reason is determinism: a replica catching up by state transfer, or replaying
a decision it never witnessed live, verifies from the request bytes alone and reaches the verdict
a replica that saw it live reached. A fingerprint plus a local certificate cache cannot promise
that, because the caches differ.

3.11.7 **`CertificateV1` has no `Version` field.** It is an allowlisted exception to §4.1 on
§3.6.1's grounds: it is an element of a SEQUENCE OF, it never appears on the wire alone, and the
containing `ClientRequestV1.Version` already governs its layout. It exists as a structure at all
because the type profile of §2.2 has no slice-of-slices, so a chain of DER blobs needs a named
element type.

3.11.8 Every constraint in the two tables is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's
grounds.

### 3.12 `ReadIndexV1`

`SignedV1.Payload` under purpose 4. A replica's attestation that its state is at `(View, Seq)`,
answering a client's freshness challenge.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `SignerID` | INTEGER | The attesting replica's node identifier. MUST be strictly positive. |
| 3 | `View` | INTEGER | MUST be non-negative. |
| 4 | `Seq` | INTEGER | MUST be non-negative. 64-bit; see §3.5. |
| 5 | `Nonce` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 16 bytes, chosen by the client. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `read-index/v1/basic`:

```
30 1e                           SEQUENCE, 30 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                Version
   02 01 03                     INTEGER 3                SignerID — node 3
   02 01 07                     INTEGER 7                View
   02 01 2a                     INTEGER 42               Seq
   04 10 a7*16                  OCTET STRING, 16 bytes   Nonce — client chosen
```

3.12.1 **`SignerID` is inside the signed bytes.** An attestation names its own signer, so it
cannot be re-attributed by whoever relays it: a signature made by node 3 covers bytes that say
node 3, and rewriting the field invalidates it. This is why the structure carries a signer where
§3.9.3 says the envelope must not — the difference is whether the identifier is under the
signature or beside it.

3.12.2 **`Nonce` is the client's freshness challenge and its width is fixed, not bounded.** A
client that accepts a short nonce accepts a narrower challenge, and how narrow is then the
attacker's choice. Sixteen bytes on both encode and decode removes the choice.

3.12.3 `SignerID` MUST be strictly positive: 0 is the consensus library's "no node", so an
attestation carrying it names nobody. A negative `View` or `Seq` is out of range per §3.5 —
both are logically unsigned and carried in a signed INTEGER.

3.12.4 Vector `read-index/v1/high-seq` carries a `Seq` past 2^32 specifically so that an
implementation parsing INTEGER into a 32-bit type fails on it rather than silently attesting to a
truncated sequence.

3.12.5 Every constraint in the table is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's grounds.

### 3.13 `CommitCertificateV1`

What a client checks to know a proposal was decided, holding nothing but genesis. It is a
**container**: it is never itself signed, and no purpose value carries it.

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Version` | INTEGER | MUST equal 1 for v1. §4.1 applies. |
| 2 | `ProposalDigest` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 32 bytes: the digest of the proposal under §3.2.3. |
| 3 | `View` | INTEGER | MUST be non-negative. |
| 4 | `Seq` | INTEGER | MUST be non-negative. |
| 5 | `Sigs` | SEQUENCE OF `SignerSigV0` | MUST be non-empty and strictly ascending by `Signer`. See §3.13.2. |

`Sigs` reuses `SignerSigV0` from §3.7 rather than declaring a fourth spelling of "a signature with
a signer attached". Within this structure its two byte fields are constrained where §3.7 leaves
them open:

| # | Field | ASN.1 | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Signer` | INTEGER | The consenter's node identifier. |
| 2 | `Value` | OCTET STRING | MUST be exactly 64 bytes: an Ed25519 signature. See §3.13.1. |
| 3 | `Msg` | OCTET STRING | The `CommitPayloadV1` of §3.10, DER. MUST be non-empty. Opaque to this layer; see §3.13.7. |

Annotated breakdown of vector `commit-cert/v1/n4-q3`:

```
30 82 01 8e                     SEQUENCE, 398 bytes
   02 01 01                     INTEGER 1                Version
   04 20 35d8…7522              OCTET STRING, 32 bytes   ProposalDigest (SHA-256 of proposal/v0/smartbft-reference)
   02 01 07                     INTEGER 7                View
   02 01 2a                     INTEGER 42               Seq
   30 82 01 5f                  SEQUENCE OF, 351 bytes   Sigs, ascending by Signer
      30 73                     SEQUENCE, 115 bytes      Sigs[0]
         02 01 01               INTEGER 1                Signer
         04 40 a1*64            OCTET STRING, 64 bytes   Value
         04 2c 302a…5558        OCTET STRING, 44 bytes   Msg — commit-payload/v1/with-aux
      30 73 … 02 01 02 …                                 Sigs[1], signer 2
      30 73 … 02 01 03 …                                 Sigs[2], signer 3
```

3.13.1 **What `Value` covers, in full, because a client implementing from this document has no
other way to learn it.** `Msg` is the DER of a `CommitPayloadV1` (§3.10). The verifier
reconstructs `SignedV1{Version: 1, Purpose: 1, GenesisDigest: <its own>, Payload: Msg}` (§3.8),
marshals it, and verifies `Value` as an Ed25519 signature over exactly those bytes under the
signer's pinned public key from `GenesisV1`. The envelope is never transmitted, here or anywhere;
this is §3.9.1's rule applied to a structure that carries several signatures instead of one. A
client MUST also check that the `ProposalDigest` inside each `Msg` equals the certificate's own
`ProposalDigest`, or the container's digest is decorative. That check is the client's, not the
container's; §3.13.7 says why.

3.13.2 **`Sigs` is strictly ascending by `Signer`, and duplicates are rejected — on encode and on
decode.** This is §2.2's producer-sorts rule with no exception, which is the opposite of §3.7.4.
The difference is deliberate and worth stating: `SignatureSetV0.Sigs` is unsorted because its
digest is order-dependent and every ledger already holds digests over the leader's order, so
sorting it now would be a breaking change. `CommitCertificateV1` is new, nothing stored depends on
its order, and a client that accepts an unsorted certificate accepts two byte strings for one
decision. Rejecting on both sides is what makes the second spelling unreachable.

3.13.3 **The signature threshold is not in this document.** How many entries a client must require
is a property of the cluster size and the fault model, it lives with the quorum arithmetic, and
this layer does not enforce it. A specification that stated a threshold it does not check would be
a claim an implementer could rely on and a verifier would not honour. What this layer guarantees
is that the entries are well-formed, unique and ordered; counting them against a quorum is the
verifier's obligation.

3.13.4 **This layer does not map `Signer` to a member.** It does not check that a signer appears in
`GenesisV1`, and it does not constrain `Signer`'s range beyond what §3.5 says about INTEGER —
`SignerSigV0` is a frozen v0 element type and §3.7 leaves its fields open. Resolving a signer to a
pinned public key is the verifying layer's work, and it is the same layer that applies §3.13.3's
threshold.

3.13.5 `Msg` MUST be non-empty, on §3.9.4's grounds: an entry with no signed message cannot be
verified by anyone, so rejecting it once here keeps that check out of every client.

3.13.6 Every constraint in the two tables is checked on encode **and** on decode, on §3.6.3's
grounds — `Msg`'s content excepted, per §3.13.7.

3.13.7 **`Msg` is not parsed by this layer.** It belongs to `SignerSigV0`, a frozen v0 element type
whose `Msg` §3.7 leaves opaque and may leave empty, so §3.13 cannot tighten how it is *parsed*
without changing what `SignatureSetV0` accepts. A producer MUST put a `CommitPayloadV1` there and a
verifying client MUST read one and apply §3.13.1; an encoder and a decoder of the container check
only that it is non-empty. Vector `commit-cert/v1/long-form-length` carries 300 opaque bytes in
`Msg` deliberately, to pin the `04 82` length form on a primitive, and is therefore a certificate
on which §3.13.1 cannot be performed. This is §3.8.5's division of labour, one structure over.

## 4. The two rules

### 4.1 V-RULE

**Every top-level structure begins with `Version`, and every decoder MUST reject a version it
does not know.** The exceptions are exhaustively:

| Structure | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `ProposalV0` | Inherits SmartBFT's frozen proposal encoding | §3.2.1 |
| `SignatureSetV0` | Inherits SmartBFT's frozen commit-signature encoding | §3.7.1 |
| `SignerSigV0` | Element of `SignatureSetV0`; same frozen encoding | §3.7.1 |
| `GenesisMemberV1` | Element of `GenesisV1`; the container's `Version` governs the layout | §3.6.1 |
| `CertificateV1` | Element of `ClientRequestV1`; the container's `Version` governs the layout | §3.11.7 |

The list is mirrored by `versionExempt` in `profile_test.go`, which fails the build for any
exported structure not on it. Adding a row is a deliberate act with a recorded reason, and a new
structure that fits neither category above does not get one.

Attack prevented: a DER decoder that maps a SEQUENCE onto a fixed field list **silently discards
trailing elements it was not expecting**. A v2 structure `{Root, Seq, Extra}` handed to a v1
decoder for `{Root, Seq}` decodes successfully with no error and no leftover bytes, and the v1
node never sees `Extra`. If `Extra` is security-relevant — a purpose tag, a new signature scope —
the v1 node validates something it did not fully read. Rejecting unknown versions is the only
mechanism that makes "frozen v1, additive only" mechanically true against that decoder behaviour.

An implementation MUST check the version before acting on any other field.

### 4.2 R-RULE

**Every decode MUST fail unless zero bytes remain after the structure.**

Attack prevented: appending bytes after a well-formed DER structure does not make it
undecodable — a permissive decoder returns the decoded value and hands the leftovers back to the
caller as a separate result. A caller that ignores the leftovers accepts `DER || 0xff 0xff` as
equivalent to `DER`, while the two have **different digests**. That is digest malleability: an
attacker mints an unlimited family of byte strings that all decode to the same authorised value
but hash differently, defeating any deduplication, equivocation check or signature scope keyed on
the digest.

An implementation MUST treat leftover bytes as a decode error, not as a warning.

4.2.1 **The same rule binds inside the structure, at every nesting depth.** Bytes left after the
outer SEQUENCE are only the outermost case of one malleability. A decoder that maps a SEQUENCE
onto a fixed field list stops when the list runs out and reports *no* leftovers, because the
surplus element sat inside that SEQUENCE's own length: `30 2e … 02 01 63` decodes to the same
`Header` as `30 2b …`, hashes differently, and hands nothing back to the caller to complain
about. The rule is therefore stated on the whole encoding: **an accepted input MUST be the exact
byte string this specification encodes that value to.** Any other byte string decoding to the same
value MUST be rejected, whichever SEQUENCE it hides in. The profile of §2 is what makes this
statable — one value has one encoding — and the cheapest implementation of it is to re-encode
what was just decoded and require the result to equal the input.

4.2.2 This is a conformance requirement, not a Go implementation detail. An implementation that
accepts a spliced encoding reproduces every vector in the annex and still disagrees with this one
on the *set of accepted inputs*, which is precisely where an attacker works: one authorised value,
two byte strings, two digests, two nodes that no longer agree. A non-Go implementation is
conformant only if it rejects the same inputs, and §4.3 says how to derive them.

### 4.3 Both rules are pinned by the annex

`TestVectorRules` takes each `Header` vector's real bytes, increments the `Version` content byte,
and requires a version error; then appends `0xff` and requires a trailing-bytes error.
`TestVectorsAreNotMalleable` takes every vector, walks every SEQUENCE at every depth, splices an
unexpected `02 01 63` into it with the enclosing lengths recomputed, and requires a decode error
for each — 4 forgeries for a two-member `GenesisV1`, one per SEQUENCE. A conformant implementation
SHOULD run the same three derivations over the annex; they need no input beyond the file itself.
`ci/verify_vectors.py` does, in Python and from this document rather than from the Go, and rejects
121 forgeries across the 30 vectors.

## 5. Merkle node hashing

Merkle node hashing does **not** use DER. It is fixed-width domain-separated concatenation, hashed
with SHA-256.

### 5.1 Common encoding

| Component | Width | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| prefix | 1 byte | see §5.2 |
| `treeID` | 8 bytes | unsigned big-endian |
| `depth` | 1 byte | unsigned, so 0..255; a producer MUST reject a deeper node rather than let it wrap |
| length prefix | 8 bytes | unsigned big-endian |
| child digest | 32 bytes | raw, **no** length prefix — the width is fixed |

### 5.2 The three node forms

```
leaf      SHA-256( 0x00 ‖ treeID ‖ depth ‖ len(key) ‖ key ‖ len(val) ‖ val )
internal  SHA-256( 0x01 ‖ treeID ‖ depth ‖ left ‖ right )
empty     SHA-256( 0x02 ‖ treeID ‖ depth )
```

Worked example, vector `merkle/leaf/basic` — `treeID` 1, `depth` 0, key `"key"`, value `"val"`:

```
00                  prefix, leaf
0000000000000001    treeID
00                  depth
0000000000000003    len(key)
6b6579              "key"
0000000000000003    len(val)
76616c              "val"
-> 6fd00b5b8e0150f8b35d08a1c712de26bf6dc47a1c50054d109642db80fcc9b9
```

### 5.3 What each bound field prevents

- **Distinct leaf and internal prefixes** prevent second-preimage attacks: without them a
  32-byte key and 32-byte value at a leaf are indistinguishable from a pair of child digests, so
  an internal node can be presented as a leaf and a proof of a fabricated value verifies.
- **`treeID`** prevents cross-tree relocation. This system has two authenticated structures, and
  without `treeID` a proof valid in one is valid in the other. Vectors `merkle/leaf/basic` and
  `merkle/leaf/tree2` differ only in `treeID` and hash differently.
- **`depth`** prevents relocation within a tree — a subtree cannot be lifted to another level.
  Vectors `merkle/leaf/basic` and `merkle/leaf/depth1` demonstrate this.
- **Length prefixes on `key` and `val`** prevent collision by re-splitting: without them
  `("ab","c")` and `("a","bc")` hash identically and two distinct states share a root.
- **The `0x02` empty prefix** keeps an empty subtree from being constructible as a leaf. Without
  a third prefix, a proof of non-membership and a proof of membership-of-the-empty-value collide.

### 5.4 Cost of the binding

`treeID` and `depth` add 9 bytes to every node preimage. Adding them after v1 ships would be a
breaking release under §1.3, so they are in v1 unconditionally.

### 5.5 Ordering

`left` and `right` are positional and MUST NOT be sorted or normalised. Swapping them yields a
different node.

### 5.6 Why this path is not DER

Measured on Apple M2 Max, Go 1.26.5:

| Operation | ns/op |
|---|---|
| DER-encode `{32-byte string, int64, int64}` (a proposal header) | 614 |
| Equivalent fixed-width concatenation | 7.5 |
| **Merkle internal node, domain-separated concatenation** | **68** |
| **Merkle internal node, DER-encoded** | **1601** |

DER-encoding Merkle nodes is 23× slower on a path that runs millions of times per compaction, and
DER by itself would not supply the domain separation §5.3 requires. Both encodings are therefore
specified, each for the job it fits.

## 6. `ConsensusTime` policy

The **encoding** of `ConsensusTime` is frozen here (§3.1: `int64` Unix nanoseconds). The
**acceptance policy** below is normative but is implemented and tested in Phase 3, at the
`VerifyProposal` call site. Nothing in Phase 1 depends on it.

6.1 The leader stamps its own wall clock into `ConsensusTime` when it constructs a proposal.

6.2 Validation MUST read no local clock. A replica accepts `t` if and only if, writing `p` for
the `ConsensusTime` of the last decision it has committed:

```
t > p
t - p <= MAX_STEP
```

`MAX_STEP` is a fixed protocol constant, identical on every replica.

6.3 §6.2 is stated negatively as well, because it is the whole point of the rule: a replica MUST
NOT compare `ConsensusTime` against its own clock. Two honest replicas with normally drifting
clocks would reach different verdicts on the same proposal, acceptance would not be a function of
committed state, and identical apply would break. An earlier version of this section required
exactly that comparison and was wrong.

6.4 The monotonicity check of §6.2 is against the last **committed** value, not a locally tracked
one. A new leader after a view change inherits `p` from the log like everyone else, so it cannot
move time backwards and there is nothing to deadlock on.

6.5 **`MAX_STEP` = 10 seconds.** Decided here rather than left open: §7.1 makes a normative edit
after this document is tagged a coordinated upgrade, so the parameter closes before the tag. The
bound is two-sided and neither side is comfortable, so both are recorded.

*Upper bound.* §6.6 lets a Byzantine leader place `ConsensusTime` anywhere in
`(p, p + MAX_STEP]`, so `MAX_STEP` is precisely how far one decision can move agreed time. One
decision must not be able to move it past a whole lease renewal interval. Kubernetes' kubelet
renews its node `Lease` every 10 seconds; at `MAX_STEP = 10s` a single proposal cannot skip one.
A consumer of this clock that renews faster than 10 seconds is outside what this value protects
and needs a bound of its own.

*Lower bound.* §6.2 admits `t ≤ p + MAX_STEP`, so an idle cluster recovers at most `MAX_STEP` of
agreed time per decision. At one decision per second, agreed time catches up at ten times real
time. Below roughly one decision per 10 seconds of real time it runs behind — silently, with no
error anywhere, which is the limitation §6.6 states rather than a new one. A smaller `MAX_STEP`
moves that threshold up to a decision rate a quiet cluster can plausibly sit under.

The constant is enforced in bft-kv's `consensus` package at `VerifyProposal`, which is where §6
already places the policy, and the drift of §6.6 is measured on a live cluster rather than
asserted.

6.6 Accepted limitation, stated rather than left implicit: a Byzantine leader can place
`ConsensusTime` anywhere in `(p, p + MAX_STEP]`, and the skew compounds across decisions. Every
honest replica still agrees on the value, so state remains deterministic and TTL expiry still
fires identically everywhere. Determinism is preserved; timeliness is not. `ConsensusTime` is a
deterministic clock, not a trustworthy one, and MUST NOT be used as evidence of when an event
actually occurred.

## 7. Compatibility

7.1 A v1 encoding is never edited. Not to fix a field name, not to reorder for readability, not
to make a field optional.

7.2 To introduce v2 of a structure:

1. Bump `Version` to 2.
2. Append the new fields after the existing ones, in declaration order.
3. Add a **new** vector to `testdata/vectors.json` for the v2 encoding. Leave every v1 vector
   untouched.
4. Ship the decoder that accepts version 2 to every replica **before** any replica emits version
   2 bytes.

7.3 A v1 node handed v2 bytes rejects them under §4.1. It does not half-read them. That rejection
is the intended behaviour and is what makes step 4 an ordering requirement rather than a
suggestion.

7.4 Removing or renaming a field, changing a field's type, changing field order, and changing a
Merkle prefix are all breaking changes under §1.3. There is no in-place migration for them: the
cluster stops, upgrades, and restarts from a state root that both versions agree on.

7.5 A conformance failure against the annex is a breaking wire change, not a broken test. The
test suite says so on failure, and the correct response is to revert the encoding change or take
§7.2, never to update the vector.
